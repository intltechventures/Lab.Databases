  + Snowflake on Amazon Web Services (AWS) represents a SQL AWS data warehouse built for the cloud
  + Snowflake's unique architecture natively handles diverse data in a single system, with the elasticity to support any scale of data, workload, and users.




## AWS Snowflake

    * "Snowflake allows you to bring together diverse data into one system for data warehousing, query processing, and analytics."
    * "Performance & Elasticity: Up to 200x faster at 1/10th the cost compared to solutions not built for the cloud."
    * "Scale storage and computing independently."
    * "You can easily scale up, out, or down, automatically to handle even multi-petabyte scale."
    * "Concurrency: Provide access to the same data for multiple workgroups or workloads, simultaneously, with no contention or performance degradation."
    * "Simplicity: No knobs, tuning, or indexing required. Pay for what you need and only when you need it. Use familiar ANSI SQL semantics on diverse data, including semi-structured data such as JSON, Avro, XML, and Parquet."

## Misc. Notes
- Snowflake is a cloud-based Data Warehouse solution provided as a Saas (Software-as-a-Service) with full support for ANSI SQL. It also has a unique architecture that enables users to just create tables and start querying data with very less administration or DBA activities needed.
- Zero management
- Storage built on S3
- Compute is separate from storage, like Amazon Aurora 
- Data processing performed by virtual warehouses, one or more clusteres of compute nodes, cached locally - designed to process enormous loads
- The Service Layer is unique
- Data is treated as relational structured data, as it loads - it discerns schema, columnairized, meta data extracted, encrypted, and compressed
- Layers:
  + Storage Layer:
    * S3
  + Compute Layer:
    * Does all the work. Virtual Warehouses - can have multiple virtual warehouses - working on the same data
  + Service Layer:
    * Understands how the data is formatted, meta data store for state management, enables all DDL functions
